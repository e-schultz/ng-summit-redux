# NOTE

This application is a little out of date, and might not work right now. I'll plan on doing an update / revision of this in the near future to reflect the most recent versions of Angular, Angular-Redux, and lessons learned over the last few years.

# App Overview

To demonstrate reactive architecture using redux + ng-redux with Angular.

# TrendyBrunch

Simple resturant application,

* Reducer for Lineup - people waiting to be seated
* Reducer for Tables - handles seated people, and their orders
* Reducer for Menu - food items available, and what is in stock


# General Idea:

* parties of people can join/leave the line
* parties get seated at tables
* tables can take place orders - add/remove items from an order, then have it
  be submitted
* UI is derived from the application data structure


# Data Structure

```
[Resturant] --------- [Menu]
  |      |               
[Line]   |             
      [Tables]
         | 
         |
      [Order]

```

# Components

There are a few examples of components, smart/dumb components, containers in this application.

In the 'Orders' component, three versions are available showing different approaches.

In `src/components/index.js` you can switch between them by commenting
out others and only bringing in the one that you want.

```javascript
// import orders from './orders-v1'; 
// import orders from './orders-v2'; 
import orders from './orders-v3'; 
```
